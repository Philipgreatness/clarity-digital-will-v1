# Digital Will Contract

A smart contract that enables users to create digital wills on the Stacks blockchain. The contract allows:

- Setting up a will with a beneficiary, inheritance amount, and time delay
- Recording activity to prevent premature execution
- Claiming inheritance after the specified delay period has passed since last activity
- Checking will details and claim status

The contract ensures that inheritance can only be claimed by the designated beneficiary after the owner has been inactive for the specified period.
